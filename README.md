Fundamentals of System-on-Chip (SoC) Design

This document summarizes the foundational concepts of System-on-Chip (SoC) design, outlining the key components, the overall design flow, and the significance of simplified learning models like BabySoC. This understanding forms the theoretical basis for the hardware development undertaken in this repository.

1. Defining the System-on-Chip (SoC)
A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that integrates nearly all components of a computer or other electronic system onto a single chip. It is, essentially, a complete electronic system packaged into a single silicon die.

Before the SoC paradigm, a complete electronic system required multiple chips mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB), with one chip for the CPU, another for memory control, another for graphics, and so on. The SoC revolution consolidated these functionalities, offering several critical advantages:

Reduced Power Consumption: Smaller distances for electrical signals to travel.

Improved Performance: Faster communication between components via high-speed on-chip interconnects.

Lower Cost and Smaller Size: Integrating everything onto one chip reduces manufacturing and assembly overhead.

Modern applications—from smartphones and smartwatches to automotive control units and high-performance computing—rely heavily on sophisticated and power-efficient SoCs.
